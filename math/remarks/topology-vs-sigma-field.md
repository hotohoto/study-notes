- topology
  - contains $\varnothing$
  - contains the $X$
  - contains a finite or infinite number of unions ⭐
  - contains a finite number of intersections
- $\sigma$-field (or $\sigma$-algebra)
  - contains the empty set

  - contains the complement of any subset ⭐

  - contains countable unions

  - contains countable intersection

- Borel algebra
  - a $\sigma$-field
  - smallest σ-algebra containing
    - all the given open sets
    - (and also their corresponding closed sets)
- Borel set

      - use interaction patterns to describe the problem in a larger context
- Enactments
  - role play and modify family patterns
  - phases
    - phase 1: Observation of spontaneous interaction
      - listen for rules an assumptions that display the family structure ofr boundaries
    - phase 2: Invitation for enactment: eliciting transactions
      - Can you reenact what happened last night?
      - Please show me what happens at home when he is defiant.
  - Boundary making

      - soften rigid boundaries
      - strengthen diffuse boundaries
    - technique
      - used to direct who participates and how
  - Family's worldview
    - Challenging unproductive assumptions by questioning operational assumptions in family system
    - common assumptions:
      - "Kids' need come first."
      - "If I give here, you should give there."
      - "It's better for the kids for us to stay in this unhappy marriage."

  - intensity
    - different levels and styles of intensity needed depending on the issue
    - turns up emotional heat using tone of voice, pacing and word choice
  - crisis induction
    - used with families who chronically avoid a problem
    - the therapist can help the family develop new interactions and patterns
- Unbalancing
  - used for extreme difficulties in hierarchy or when (IP) is being scapegoated
  - Use expert position to temporarily "join sides" with scapegoated individuals or subsystems that need stronger boundaries
  - done only briefly ad with specific realignment goals in mind
    - only after more direct interventions, such as enactments and challenging assumptions, have failed.
- Expanding family truth
  - Allows family to maintain core beliefs but use them in new ways
- Circular Questioning
  - What would John say..?
  - Think in other member's shoes.
- join family systems
- compliments and shaping competence
  - Used to bolster behaviors that support families in moving toward goals
  - Noticing small successes along the way to reaching goals
    - Families usually improve after enactments and refrain from interrupting in later sessions. Therapists shape competence by noticing changes in session.

### Goals

- Therapeutic spontaneity
- Therapist's use of self

  - professionally detached
- make it happen
  - Do whatever it takes to make change happen

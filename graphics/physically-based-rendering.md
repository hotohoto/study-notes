# Physically based rendering

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Literate Programming

- tell computer what we want to do rather than telling what computer do
- source codes can contain `<<fragment>>`

### 1.2 Photorealistic Rendering and the Ray-Tracing Algorithm

- make it indistinguishable from a photo graph
  - depends on observer
- it's enough to regard light as particles rather than waves
- Ray-tracer
  - camera
    - "Many rendering systems generate viewing rays starting at the camera that are then traced into the scene to determine which objects are visible at each pixel."
  - Ray-object intersections
  - Light sources
  - Visibility
  - Light scattering at surfaces
  - Indirect light transport
  - Ray propagation

#### 1.2.1 Cameras and film

- viewing volume
  - the region of space that can potentially be imaged on the film
- "Most camera sensors record separate measurements for **three wavelength distributions** that correspond to red, green, and blue colors, which is sufficient to reconstruct a sceneâ€™s visual appearance to a human observer."

(notes)

- Humans have three types of cone cells L/M/S
  - that's why we represent colors with three independent channels

#### 1.2.2 Ray-Object Interactions

What am I passionate about?

I tried to think what I am passionate about. Learning is the first, and I like the feeling of improving. I like teaching as well. I think teaching is one of the best ways of learning. I still remember several years a go my mom praised me of teaching her how to use her cell phone. In the middle school I didn't put much effort on studyin in school. But I started to learn how to program softwares then. When I entered highschool I studied from 6 in the morning to 11 at night for 3 years. I liked that period of time in my life. I used to help other students solve math problems. In my compnay, all of us took a test called Clifton Strength to see the strength for each person. As a result, one of the main themes of mine was Learner.

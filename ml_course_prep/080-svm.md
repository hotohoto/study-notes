# SVM

## Terminologies

- margin
- hyperplane
  - wx + b = 0
  - w: normal vector of hyperplane
  - it can be any hyper plane by changing w and b (but later we're going to place it between supporter vectors)
  - x: p-dimensional
  - b / ||w|| : distance between the origin and the hyperplane
- support vector
- planes passing by support vectors
  - wx_i + b = 1
  - wx_j + b = -1
  - margin = 2 / ||w||
- Lagrange Multiplier
- `w`
- dual problem.
  - can be considered as the Pringles problem
    - finds maximum among minimum points
    - or finds minimum among maximum points
  - it solves the same problem as the primal problem.

- primal problem
  - maximizes margin

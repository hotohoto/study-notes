# How to research

- Come up with a new idea/method I want to investigate
- Read papers
  - the papers with codes are more priority
  - and the prerequisite papers might be the next
  - the other papers are all optional and they are basically just for getting some intuition
  - Ask people to read main papers you're interested in to have discussion
- Pick the main paper
  - Pick a SOTA model if codes are available
  - Reproduce the model
  - Try the minimal configuration of the model ⭐

- If the code is not clean and a lot changes are required
  - prepare a refactored/new code base
    - otherwise I'll be facing time-spending debugging issues...

- if not,
  - don't spend much time on it
- Repeat
  - design experiments
    - Use the minimal configuration ⭐
    - Make everything configurable and comparable⭐
    - Add a single change onto the baseline result
      - for you're mostly likely to fail due to bugs or misunderstanding
  - Try them all
  - Analyze it
  - discuss it



## Team works

- Grab the bird-eye-view of the task
  - things are more dynamic and unstructured than regular engineering/development process



## Patent writing

- The more general the better, but keep it specific for clarity at first
  - add generalization later with your patent agent.
- example layout for the presentation file
  - background
  - related research
  - issues and limitation
  - patent ideas

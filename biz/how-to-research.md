- Pick a SOTA model
- Read all the papers related
  - e.g. let's secure a month to do so

- Reproduce the SOTA model
- Try the minimal configuration of the model ⭐
- If the code is not clean, prepare the code base
- Repeat
  - design experiments
    - Use the minimal configuration ⭐
    - Make everything configurable and comparable⭐

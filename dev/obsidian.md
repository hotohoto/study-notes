## WSL issues

- Using vault in a WSL path doesn't work
	- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/support-for-vaults-in-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl/8580/69
- Using vault in a windows path looks slow.
- Install obsidian in WSL is possible (seems not recommended though)
- download `.deb` file from https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases

```
sudo dkpg -i obsidian_1.8.10_amd64.deb
```

- Korean are broken ðŸ«¤

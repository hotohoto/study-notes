- Why AI is Harder Than We Think
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12871
  - Summary
    - The process of human intelligence is more complex than we think.
      - There are unexpected obstacles between narrow and general intelligence.
      - Human intelligence is integrated with body, emotions, desires, a strong sense of selfhood and autonomy, and a commonsense understanding of the world.
        - Not clear if these can be separated
    - Wishful mnemonics misleads us about our understanding AI

- Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661
  - https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/
  - used sine functions which is periodic as for activation functions
    - NN weights will act as angular velocity
    - NN bias will shift phase
    - Since the cosine function is the derivative of sine function and they are different only by the phase, we can easily derive the derivative function of whole NN.
    - NN is now much better at representation especially for images or audio signals.
    - NN can be trained much faster than when using other activation function.
    - Weights should be carefuly initialized.
  - (addtionally)
    - We can train a NN to represent an image by training it to take inputs of coordinates and returns a color
    - We can use NN to solve mathematical or physical problems such as PDE or Obtimizaiton problems just by setting the loss function properly.

- Lecture notes on ridge regression (v5)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09169
  - high dimensional data would be collinear
    - then the moment matrix is singular
      - moment matrixes are symmetric
      - symmetric matrixes have orthogonal eigenvectors
      - moment matrixes can be decomposed as the sum of products of all eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenvector, and its transposed vector.
      - the inverse of moment matrixes can be decomposed as the sum of products of all reciprocal values of eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector, and its transposed vector.
    - then OLS has no solution
  - as ad-hoc, we can add diagonal values to the moment matrix to make it nonsingular
  - as post-hoc, minimizing squared error with ridge penalty can be considered as equivalent
  - Bayesian linear regression can be considered as equivalent as well
  - ridge regressor is a biased estimator

- The Optimal Ridge Penalty for Real-world High-dimensional Data Can Be Zero or Negative due to the Implicit Ridge Regularization
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10939
  - when n << p, the λ → 0 limit, corresponding to the minimum-norm OLS solution, can have good generalization performance
    - minimum-norm OLS can be found by pseudo inverse just like plain OLS solutions
  - explicit ridge regularization with λ > 0 can fail to provide any further improvement;
  - moreover, the optimal value of λ in this regime can be negative;
  - this happens when the response variable is predicted by the high-variance directions while the low-variance directions together with the minimum-norm requirement effectively perform shrinkage and provide implicit ridge regularization
  - OLS, minimum-norm OLS

- Entity Embedding of Categorical Variables
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06737
  - Cheng Guo, Felix Berkhahn
  - Each one-hot encoded field is mapped into an Euclidean space
    - all those outputs are concatenated with of other varaibles
    - and they all are trained in a network at the same time.
  - The entitiy embedding matrix for each category field can be used for visualizing categorical data
  - The concatenated outputs can be used for data clustering
  - one-hot encoded values are mapped
  - questions
    - how to choose the embedding dimension??
      - the more complex the more dimensions
      - guess how many features might be needed to describe the entities
      - start with the number of categories minus one
    - Linear Relation Embeddings vs Structured Embeddings

- more details can be found at https://github.com/FirasGit/medicaldiffusion

### 2.2 Data preprocessing

- histogram based intensity normalization
  - seems to have been devised for MRI images
  - not sure how much this is important ü§î


### 2.3 Architecture

#### VQ-GAN

- discriminators
  - a slice-wise discriminator
    - takes a random slice
  - a 3D discriminator
- feature matching loss

#### Diffusion model

- DDPM
- basic composition (in order) ‚≠ê
  - 2D conv
    - 3x3x1 kernel
  - a spatial attention block
  - a depth attention block

#### Putting it all together

- trained on 1GPU with 24G VRAM

## 3 Results

### 3.2 Medical diffusion models can generate high quality medical 3d data

- two radiologists evaluate 20 generated 3D images for each dataset

### 3.3 The dimension of the latent space is important  for high quality image generation

### 3.5 Synthetic data can be used to train neural networks

## Discussion

- limitations
  - small datasets
    - 1000 volumes
  - low resolution volumes
  - image quality and resolution trade off

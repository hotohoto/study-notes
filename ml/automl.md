# AutoML

- Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
  - https://www.automl.org/automl/literature-on-neural-architecture-search/
  - sampling architecture
  - grow the network progressively
  - NAS, ENAS, PNAS, DARTS, P-DARTS, SPOS, CDARTS

- Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS)
  - make algorithm flexible and let the autoML tune the hyper-parameters (activation function, skip connection, optimizer, ...)

- ETransformer
  - for "tabular data"
  - questions
    - what competition? and got 2nd rank
    - how CNN can handle rotated images?
- AutoRL
  - optimize both reward and the network

- weight agnostic neural net
